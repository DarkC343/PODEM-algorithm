# PODEM-algorithm
Path Oriented DEcision Making (PODEM) is an [ATPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_test_pattern_generation) algorithm used in digital circuit testing that finds test vectors to uncover single [stuck-at faults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuck-at_fault) (SSFs) which may happen to signal lines in fabrication process. As the goal of testing is to prevent shipping of faulty chips to customers, manufacturers expect high fault coverage and low defect level.
